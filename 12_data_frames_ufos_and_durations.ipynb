I was walking around the corner of m street when i just took a quick glance at the sky.  Right as i take that glance i see a red and white light trail and it just dissapeared.  It was way too fast be any aircraft such as a plane or a helicopter. Im not sure if it was a UFO or a shooting star, But i know that a shooting star is white and a bright red.</td></tr>\n",

I was walking around the corner of m street when i just took a quick glance at the sky.  Right as i take that glance i see a red and white light trail and it just dissapeared.  It was way too fast be any aircraft such as a plane or a helicopter. Im not sure if it was a UFO or a shooting star, But i know that a shooting star is white and a bright red.\\\\\n",

I was walking around the corner of m street when i just took a quick glance at the sky.  Right as i take that glance i see a red and white light trail and it just dissapeared.  It was way too fast be any aircraft such as a plane or a helicopter. Im not sure if it was a UFO or a shooting star, But i know that a shooting star is white and a bright red."
