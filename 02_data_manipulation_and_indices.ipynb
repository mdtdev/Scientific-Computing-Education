    "The emphasis is on the R language, but as the class is delivered in Jupyter notebooks, we will cover the basics of this system, as well. Both R and Jupyter are systems that are too big to be covered in one class, so this is really just enough to get you started with either of them. For more information on Jupyter see the [Jupyter Project website](http://jupyter.org/). For more on R, see the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/).\n",
