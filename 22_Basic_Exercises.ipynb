The key here is to remember that the items must be named. The R documentation describes `t.test` as having the following format for its input:\n",

    "       conf.level = 0.95)\n",

    "1. `t.test(g1, g2)`\n",
    "1. `t.test(x = g1, y = g2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the other values are optional and will use defaults if not given by you. Most people use the first format for simple things, but we can choose to use the second if we need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, when you place `...` inside of a function definition, that spot collects all of the variables with names that the current function does **not** use. These then can be sent to other functions as needed. Those other functions will look through the list of spare variables and select out ones with names they recognize.\n",
