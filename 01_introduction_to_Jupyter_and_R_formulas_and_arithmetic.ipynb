    "+ The R Language\n",
    "+ The Jupyter Scientific Notebook System\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis is on the R language, but as the class is delivered in Jupyter notebooks, we will cover the basics of this system, as well. Both R and Jupyter are systems that are too big to be covered in one class, so this is really just enough to get you started with either of them. For more information on Jupyter see the [Jupyter Project website](http://jupyter.org/). For more on R, see the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/).\n",

    "\n",
    "You are currently looking at a **Jupyter Notebook for R**. This is an easy to use system for working with scientific computing. Many of you will prefer to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) on your own computers. However, when working in a networked environment, Jupyter is better for sharing. (There is a web-based version of RStudio, however it is not an affordable option for GSU.) If you would like to use Jupyter on your own computer it is _relatively_ easy to set up. This will not be discussed today, please contact the workshop leader for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that R is a computer language, _so while interacting with R notebooks in Jupyter will feel different from the workflow in RStudio, the **commands are identical**_.

These are usually made available online via the _Comprehensive R Archive Network_ (CRAN), a collection of computer servers located all around the world where each  one holds a copy of all public R packages. Packages are loaded with either the `require` or `library` command. The first command is usually used in programs written in R, while the second, `library`, is preferred for interactive work in R. "
