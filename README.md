# Scientific-Computing-Education
Materials for education about scientific computing. Pretty obvious.

This is not officially released or supported yet. So please keep the draft nature of this in mind. I will change this README when it is done.

Please note that these notebooks were developed for the DICE computing environment at Georgia State University, so:
1. You may need to install missing libraries
1. Output renders differently under different systems/configurations. (For instance, Github's renderer adds some extra numbers to the output!)

If there are other issues, please let me know!

Good luck!
