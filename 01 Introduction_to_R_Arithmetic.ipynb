    "This workshop is intended as a brief introduction to:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The R Language\n",
    "+ The Jupyter Scientific Notebook System\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis is on the R language, but as the class is delivered in Jupyter notebooks, we will cover the basics of this system, as well. Both R and Jupyter are systems that are too big to be covered in one class, so this is really just enough to get you started with either of them. For more information on Jupyter see the [Jupyter Project website](http://jupyter.org/). For more on R, see the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/).\n",

    "## Section 1: Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with Jupyter so that you can work with it today.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are currently looking at a **Jupyter Notebook for R**. This is an easy to use system for working with scientific computing. Many of you will prefer to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) on your own computers. However, when working in a networked environment, Jupyter is better for sharing. (There is a web-based version of RStudio, however it is not an affordable option for GSU.) If you would like to use Jupyter on your own computer it is _relatively_ easy to set up. This will not be discussed today, please contact the workshop leader for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that R is a computer language, _so while interacting with R notebooks in Jupyter will feel different from the workflow in RStudio, the **commands are identical**_. For more information on using Jupyter notebooks for research and teaching, see [HERE](https://jupyter.brynmawr.edu/services/public/dblank/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb) (note that this page is a little out of date but still very useful).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells (The essential feature of Jupyter)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is organized into **cells** which are little blocks of code or formatted text. The output of cells is either statistical results or graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This text that you are reading is a **text** cell. Below this is a **code** cell that is empty. Let's try using it:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Double-click on the cell below this\n",
    "+ Type `2 + 2` (or some other numbers of interest)\n",
    "+ Then press shift-enter (shift and the enter or return key on your keyboard; **remember this, you use it constantly!**)"

    "Note a couple of things:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The result is printed just below the cell\n",
    "+ The cell gets a **number** showing the order in which it was run (in this case 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to click on the cell again, you could change your code and then press shift-enter to run it again. The results will update to show the new result and the number of the cell will increment to the next number. Try it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text and Code Together in Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great feature of Jupyter notebooks is that they allow the mixing of text, data, and computer code. Everything in this notebook, including **this cell's text**, is editable. If you would like to see the raw form of this typeset text, just _double_ click inside of this cell. The typesetting is done in [markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) a **simple code for marking up text** with things like: headings, web links, lists, computer code, and so on. It also supports typesetting math in LaTeX (if you are familiar with that). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: writing $C = 2 \\pi r$ or $e^x=\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{i!}x^i$ is fairly easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells are executed (code is run, text is formatted) when you press shift-enter while within the cell. Just click on the cell to make it the active cell (or double-click to make it active and editable if it is a text cell) and that will be the cell that gets executed when you press shift-enter."
