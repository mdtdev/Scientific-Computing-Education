    "# Bootstrapping\n",
    "A very general statistical technique is the [bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28statistics%29) invented by the statistician [Brad Efron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Efron) in the [late 1970's](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aos/1176344552). The central idea of bootstrapping is to **resample** data using some form of sampling _with replacement_. In essence, it replaces parametric assumptions with computing power. The method is related (in an evolutionary sense) to other methods such as [cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_%28statistics%29) and the [jacknife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackknife_resampling) (see also [this](http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/~hchen/teaching/LargeSample/references/Miller74jackknife.pdf)), the latter being developed by [Quenouille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Quenouille); and all of these are very useful in machine learning and regression contexts. The bootstrap was originally introduced to estimate **bias** in statistical estimators. A good summary of uses for the bootstrap is given [here](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1177013815).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Bootstrap?\n",
    "The bootstrap uses the sample as a [plug-in estimate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236647074_Using_Bootstrap_Estimation_and_the_Plug-in_Principle_for_Clinical_Psychology_Data) of the distribution (population) from which the data was drawn. Traditional statistics assumes a parametric form (usually the normal or Gaussian) for this population. The assumption is that the features of the distribution are reflected in the same features of the sample. Wikipedia describes it:\n",
    "\n",
    "> More formally, the bootstrap works by treating inference of the true probability distribution J, given the original data, as being analogous to inference of the empirical distribution 調, given the resampled data. The accuracy of inferences regarding 調 using the resampled data can be assessed because we know 調. If 調 is a reasonable approximation to J, then the quality of inference on J can in turn be inferred. [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28statistics%29#Approach).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in essence, we treat **resamples** (with replacement) from the sample as being analogous to a collection of **samples** from the original population. (Resamples are to the sample, what samples are to the population.) Despite the fact that this sounds somewhat silly (it really does seem like a magic trick!) it tends to work in a lot of applied cases. Also, there has been a thorough theoretical basis developed for the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**Important Note**: Although the simplest form of bootstrapping discussed here does work for some problems, it is **not** to be taken as a general technique to be used without significant study on your part. In general, this simplest version of the method is **not** to be used directly for real-world data problems, but should instead be replaced by several better, somewhat more complicated, methods such as the **bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap**, the **ABC bootstrap**, and the **bootstrap-T**. All of these are covered in [DiCiccio and Efron (1996)](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1032280214), and [Carpenter and Bithell (2000)](https://www.tau.ac.il/~saharon/Boot/10.1.1.133.8405.pdf) provides a general survey. For the average user, Carpenter and Bithell may be the best available paper to start your reading. For a less technical introduction, see [Wright, London, and Field (2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236647074_Using_Bootstrap_Estimation_and_the_Plug-in_Principle_for_Clinical_Psychology_Data), however this paper does not go into detail on the more advanced methods.</span>\n",

    "## Why Discuss This Here?\n",
    "Implementing the bootstrap in R requires using either functions or loops, or both, so it is a good topic to show off using these structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "To fully follow the bootstrap details in this section, you will need to know a little bit about statistical inference, normal theory, confidence intervals, and probability. To follow just the parts dealing with using the structures from this workshop, you can ignore some of the details and you should be fine.\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Bootstrap Example (Means)\n",
    "In this notebook we will analyze a very simple case using the **percentile bootstrap**. This is a method for estimating upper and lower bounds for the confidence interval (CI) around the mean. You hopefully remember confidence intervals from introductory statistics, particularly CI's under the assumption of a normal distribution. We will review this below a little bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data is symmetric and there is a large sample this percentile bootstrap method works well, however for most real-world problems it should be replaced by the BC<sub>a</sub> (bias-corrected and accelerated) bootstrap. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's generate a random set of data to use for analysis. We use `rnorm` which makes up normally distributed random numbers. Here we make 100 random numbers, from a distribution with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell we also use the `set.seed` function in R which \"reboots\" the random number generator and sets it to a specific starting state. This makes sure that when you run this file you get the same random numbers each time."

    "+ We **always** sample with replacement. The reason for this is that if we did not do so, then each resample would be identical with the original data. So we have to set `replace = TRUE` in all of our work.\n",
    "+ We make the resamples the same size as the original data set. This is because the behavior of samples depends on the size of the sample and we want to explore the behavior of samples that are the same size as our data set.\n",
