Here we are told that a test of significance on whether **any** of the sprays are different from the others is significant. You can tell this from the $p$-value, which is effectively zero, or, if you were taught to read them, from the significance codes (`***`). Either way, the ANOVA tells us that at least one of the sprays is different from the others.\n",
